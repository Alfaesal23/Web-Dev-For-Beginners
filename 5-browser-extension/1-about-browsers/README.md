### Introduction

Have you ever wished you could add a custom button to your browser or automatically fill in forms with your information? That's exactly what browser extensions do! They're like having a personal assistant built right into your browser, ready to help with whatever you need.

Browser extensions are mini-applications that live inside your browser - think of them as your browser's superpowers. From password managers that keep your accounts secure to color pickers that help designers grab perfect shades, extensions make your web browsing so much more efficient and enjoyable.

Before we jump into building your very own extension, let's take a peek under the hood to see how browsers actually work. Don't worry - this isn't going to be a boring technical deep-dive! Understanding these basics will help you build extensions that work smoothly and make sense to your users.

By the end of this lesson, you'll not only understand how browsers tick, but you'll also have started building your first real extension. Pretty exciting, right? Let's get started!

## Understanding Web Browsers

Let's start with the basics - what exactly is a browser, and how does it work its magic? Understanding this will help you build extensions that feel natural and work seamlessly with what your browser is already doing.

Think of your web browser as a super-smart translator. When you type "google.com" into the address bar, your browser doesn't just magically know what to show you. It's actually doing a lot of behind-the-scenes work - like asking servers around the world for content, then translating all that code into the beautiful, interactive web pages you see every day.

âœ… **A little history**: The first browser was called 'WorldWideWeb' and was created by Sir Timothy Berners-Lee in 1990.

### How Browsers Process Web Content

Ever wonder what happens in those few seconds between hitting Enter and seeing a webpage? Let's follow that journey together - it's actually pretty fascinating!

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant Browser
    participant DNS
    participant Server
    
    User->>Browser: Types URL and presses Enter
    Browser->>DNS: Looks up server IP address
    DNS->>Browser: Returns IP address
    Browser->>Server: Requests web page content
    Server->>Browser: Sends HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
    Browser->>User: Renders complete web page
```

**Here's what this process accomplishes:**
- **Translates** the human-readable URL into a server IP address through DNS lookup
- **Establishes** a secure connection with the web server using HTTP or HTTPS protocols
- **Requests** the specific web page content from the server
- **Receives** HTML markup, CSS styling, and JavaScript code from the server
- **Renders** all content into the interactive web page you see

### Browser Core Features

Now here's where it gets interesting for us extension builders! Modern browsers come packed with features that we can tap into to make our extensions awesome:

| Feature | Purpose | Extension Opportunities |
|---------|---------|------------------------|
| **Rendering Engine** | Displays HTML, CSS, and JavaScript | Content modification, styling injection |
| **JavaScript Engine** | Executes JavaScript code | Custom scripts, API interactions |
| **Local Storage** | Saves data locally | User preferences, cached data |
| **Network Stack** | Handles web requests | Request monitoring, data analysis |
| **Security Model** | Protects users from malicious content | Content filtering, security enhancements |

**Understanding these features helps you:**
- **Identify** where your extension can add the most value
- **Choose** the right browser APIs for your extension's functionality
- **Design** extensions that work efficiently with browser systems
- **Ensure** your extension follows browser security best practices

### Cross-Browser Development Considerations

Here's something that might surprise you - not all browsers are created equal! Each one has its own personality, if you will. Chrome might handle something differently than Firefox, and that's totally normal. As we build extensions together, we'll learn to work with these differences rather than fight against them.

> ðŸ’¡ **Pro Tip**: Use [caniuse.com](https://www.caniuse.com) to check which web technologies are supported across different browsers. This is invaluable when planning your extension's features!

**Key considerations for extension development:**
- **Test** your extension across Chrome, Firefox, and Edge browsers
- **Adapt** to different browser extension APIs and manifest formats
- **Handle** varying performance characteristics and limitations
- **Provide** fallbacks for browser-specific features that may not be available

âœ… **Analytics Insight**: You can determine which browsers your users prefer by installing analytics packages in your web development projects. This data helps you prioritize which browsers to support first.

## Understanding Browser Extensions

You know those little moments when you're browsing and think "I wish I could just..."? Maybe you want to quickly save an article for later, or grab that perfect color from a website, or translate a funny meme your friend sent you. That's exactly where browser extensions shine!

Extensions are like having a toolbox right inside your browser. Instead of opening separate apps or switching between windows, everything you need is just a click away. They're designed to solve those everyday web browsing frustrations and make your online life smoother.

**Popular extension categories and their benefits:**
- **Productivity Tools**: Task managers, note-taking apps, and time trackers that help you stay organized
- **Security Enhancements**: Password managers, ad blockers, and privacy tools that protect your data
- **Developer Tools**: Code formatters, color pickers, and debugging utilities that streamline development
- **Content Enhancement**: Reading modes, video downloaders, and screenshot tools that improve your web experience

âœ… **Reflection Question**: What are your favorite browser extensions? What specific tasks do they perform, and how do they improve your browsing experience?

## Installing and Managing Extensions

Before we start building, let's get familiar with how extensions actually get into your browser. Think of this as learning the neighborhood before you move in - it'll help you understand what your users will experience when they install your creation!

The good news? Installing extensions is pretty straightforward across all browsers. There are a few small differences here and there, but once you've done it in one browser, you'll feel comfortable in any of them.

> **Important**: Make sure to toggle on developer mode and allow extensions from other stores when testing your own extensions.

### Development Extension Installation Process

When you're developing and testing your own extensions, follow this workflow:

```bash
# Step 1: Build your extension
npm run build
```

**What this command accomplishes:**
- **Compiles** your source code into browser-ready files
- **Bundles** JavaScript modules into optimized packages
- **Generates** the final extension files in the `/dist` folder
- **Prepares** your extension for installation and testing

**Step 2: Navigate to Browser Extensions**
1. **Open** your browser's extensions management page
2. **Click** the "Settings and more" button (the `...` icon) on the top right
3. **Select** "Extensions" from the dropdown menu

**Step 3: Load Your Extension**
- **For new installations**: Choose `load unpacked` and select your `/dist` folder
- **For updates**: Click `reload` next to your already-installed extension
- **For testing**: Enable "Developer mode" to access additional debugging features

### Production Extension Installation

> âœ… **Note**: These development instructions are specifically for extensions you build yourself. To install published extensions, visit the official browser extension stores like the [Microsoft Edge Add-ons store](https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/Microsoft-Edge-Extensions-Home).

**Understanding the difference:**
- **Development installations** let you test unpublished extensions during development
- **Store installations** provide vetted, published extensions with automatic updates
- **Sideloading** allows installation of extensions from outside official stores (requires developer mode)

## Building Your Carbon Footprint Extension

Ready to build something cool? We're going to create a browser extension that shows you the carbon footprint of your region's energy use. Not only will this teach you all the essential extension development skills, but you'll also end up with something that's actually meaningful and useful!

I love this project because it combines learning with purpose. Every time you use your extension, you'll get a little reminder about your environmental impact. Plus, you might be surprised by what you discover about your local energy sources - I know I was when I first built this!

### Project Requirements

Before we dive into the fun stuff, let's gather everything we need. Don't worry - it's not as complicated as it might look!

**Required API Access:**
- **[CO2 Signal API key](https://www.co2signal.com/)**: Enter your email address to receive your free API key
- **[Region code](http://api.electricitymap.org/v3/zones)**: Find your region code using the [Electricity Map](https://www.electricitymap.org/map) (for example, Boston uses 'US-NEISO')

**Development Tools:**
- **[Node.js and NPM](https://www.npmjs.com)**: Package management tool for installing project dependencies
- **[Starter code](../start)**: Download the `start` folder to begin development

### Understanding the Project Structure

Let's take a quick tour of our extension's folder structure. Think of this as getting familiar with your new workspace - once you know where everything lives, development becomes so much smoother!

```
project-root/
â”œâ”€â”€ dist/                    # Built extension files
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ manifest.json        # Extension configuration
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ index.html           # User interface markup
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ background.js        # Background script functionality
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ main.js              # Compiled JavaScript bundle
â””â”€â”€ src/                     # Source development files
    â””â”€â”€ index.js             # Your main JavaScript code
```

**Breaking down what each file accomplishes:**
- **`manifest.json`**: **Defines** extension metadata, permissions, and entry points
- **`index.html`**: **Creates** the user interface that appears when users click your extension
- **`background.js`**: **Handles** background tasks and browser event listeners
- **`main.js`**: **Contains** the final bundled JavaScript after the build process
- **`src/index.js`**: **Houses** your main development code that gets compiled into `main.js`

> ðŸ’¡ **Organization Tip**: Store your API key and region code in a secure note for easy reference during development. You'll need these values to test your extension's functionality.

âœ… **Security Note**: Never commit API keys or sensitive credentials to your code repository. We'll show you how to handle these securely in the next steps.

## Creating the Extension Interface

Time for the exciting part - building what users will actually see and interact with! We're going to create two simple but effective screens that work together beautifully.

Think of it like this: the first screen is where users tell your extension about themselves (like their region and API key), and the second screen is where the magic happens - showing them their carbon footprint data. It's a simple, logical flow that won't confuse anyone.

### Extension Views Overview

**Setup View** - First-time user configuration:
![screenshot of the completed extension open in a browser, displaying a form with inputs for region name and API key.](images/1.png)

**Results View** - Carbon footprint data display:
![screenshot of the completed extension displaying values for carbon usage and fossil fuel percentage for the US-NEISO region.](images/2.png)

### Building the Configuration Form

Let's start with the setup form - this is where users will enter their information the first time they use your extension. The cool thing is, once they've set it up, they won't need to do this again!

In the `/dist/index.html` file, add this form structure:

```html
<form class="form-data" autocomplete="on">
    <div>
        <h2>New? Add your Information</h2>
    </div>
    <div>
        <label for="region">Region Name</label>
        <input type="text" id="region" required class="region-name" />
    </div>
    <div>
        <label for="api">Your API Key from tmrow</label>
        <input type="text" id="api" required class="api-key" />
    </div>
    <button class="search-btn">Submit</button>
</form>
```

**Here's what this form accomplishes:**
- **Creates** a semantic form structure with proper labels and input associations
- **Enables** browser autocomplete functionality for improved user experience
- **Requires** both fields to be filled before submission using the `required` attribute
- **Organizes** inputs with descriptive class names for easy styling and JavaScript targeting
- **Provides** clear instructions for users who are setting up the extension for the first time

### Building the Results Display

Next, create the results area that will show the carbon footprint data. Add this HTML below the form:

```html
<div class="result">
    <div class="loading">loading...</div>
    <div class="errors"></div>
    <div class="data"></div>
    <div class="result-container">
        <p><strong>Region: </strong><span class="my-region"></span></p>
        <p><strong>Carbon Usage: </strong><span class="carbon-usage"></span></p>
        <p><strong>Fossil Fuel Percentage: </strong><span class="fossil-fuel"></span></p>
    </div>
    <button class="clear-btn">Change region</button>
</div>
```

**Breaking down what this structure provides:**
- **`loading`**: **Displays** a loading message while API data is being fetched
- **`errors`**: **Shows** error messages if API calls fail or data is invalid
- **`data`**: **Holds** raw data for debugging purposes during development
- **`result-container`**: **Presents** formatted carbon footprint information to users
- **`clear-btn`**: **Allows** users to change their region and reconfigure the extension

### Setting Up the Build Process

Now let's install the project dependencies and test the build process:

```bash
npm install
```

**What this installation process accomplishes:**
- **Downloads** Webpack and other development dependencies specified in `package.json`
- **Configures** the build toolchain for compiling modern JavaScript
- **Prepares** the development environment for extension building and testing
- **Enables** code bundling, optimization, and cross-browser compatibility features

> ðŸ’¡ **Build Process Insight**: Webpack bundles your source code from `/src/index.js` into `/dist/main.js`. This process optimizes your code for production and ensures browser compatibility.

### Testing Your Progress

At this point, you can test your extension:

1. **Run** the build command to compile your code
2. **Load** the extension into your browser using the developer mode
3. **Verify** that the form displays correctly and looks professional
4. **Check** that all form elements are properly aligned and functional

**Look at what you've accomplished:**
- **Built** the foundational HTML structure for your extension
- **Created** both configuration and results interfaces that actually look professional
- **Set up** a modern development workflow (you're basically a pro now!)
- **Prepared** everything for the next phase where we'll bring it to life with JavaScript

Seriously, take a moment to appreciate what you've just done! You've taken the first major step in browser extension development. The hardest part - getting started - is behind you. In our next lesson, we'll add the JavaScript magic that will make your extension truly interactive and useful. You're going to love seeing it come together!

## GitHub Copilot Agent Challenge ðŸš€

Use the Agent mode to complete the following challenge:

**Description:** Enhance the browser extension by adding form validation and user feedback features to improve the user experience when entering API keys and region codes.

**Prompt:** Create JavaScript validation functions that check if the API key field contains at least 20 characters and if the region code follows the correct format (like 'US-NEISO'). Add visual feedback by changing input border colors to green for valid inputs and red for invalid ones. Also add a toggle feature to show/hide the API key for security purposes.

Learn more about [agent mode](https://code.visualstudio.com/blogs/2025/02/24/introducing-copilot-agent-mode) here.

## ðŸš€ Challenge

Take a look at a browser extension store and install one to your browser. You can examine its files in interesting ways. What do you discover?
