# AI Framework

AI frameworks are powerful tools that can dramatically accelerate your development process when building intelligent applications. Think of an AI framework as a comprehensive toolkit that provides pre-built components, standardized APIs, and intelligent abstractions to help you focus on solving problems rather than wrestling with low-level implementation details.

In this lesson, you'll discover how frameworks like LangChain can transform complex AI integration tasks into manageable, readable code. You'll learn to handle real-world challenges like maintaining conversation context, implementing tool calling, and managing different AI models through a unified interface.

By the end of this project, you'll understand when to choose frameworks over direct API calls, how to leverage their abstractions effectively, and how to build production-ready AI applications with confidence. Let's explore the world of AI frameworks and unlock their potential for your projects!

## Why choose a framework?

When building AI applications, you have several integration approaches available, each with distinct advantages and trade-offs. Understanding these options helps you make informed architectural decisions for your projects.

Let's explore the three main approaches to AI integration:

| Approach | Advantages | Best For | Considerations |
|----------|------------|----------|--------------|
| **Direct HTTP Requests** | Full control, no dependencies | Simple queries, learning fundamentals | More verbose code, manual error handling |
| **SDK Integration** | Less boilerplate, model-specific optimization | Single-model applications | Limited to specific providers |
| **AI Frameworks** | Unified API, built-in abstractions | Multi-model apps, complex workflows | Learning curve, potential over-abstraction |

### Framework Benefits in Practice

    B --> G[Built-in Tools]
    G --> H[Memory Management]
    G --> I[Conversation History]
    G --> J[Function Calling]
    G --> K[Error Handling]
```

**Key framework advantages:**
- **Unifies** multiple AI providers under a single API
- **Handles** conversation memory and context automatically
- **Provides** built-in tools for common tasks like embeddings and function calling
- **Manages** error handling and retry logic
- **Abstracts** complex workflows into simple method calls

> ðŸ’¡ **Pro Tip**: Choose frameworks when you need to switch between different AI models or implement complex features like agents, memory, or tool calling. Use direct APIs when you're learning fundamentals or building simple, single-purpose integrations.

**Remember**: Use the right tool for the job. Frameworks excel at complex, multi-feature applications, while direct APIs work well for simple, focused use cases.

## Introduction

In this lesson, we'll learn to:

- Use a common AI framework.
- Address common problems like chat conversations, tool usage, memory and context.
- Leverage this to build AI apps.

## Your first AI prompt

Let's start with the fundamentals by creating a simple AI application that sends a prompt and receives a response. This example demonstrates how frameworks simplify what would otherwise require complex HTTP request handling.

### Setting up LangChain with GitHub Models

We'll use LangChain to connect to GitHub Models, which provides free access to various AI models. The setup requires just a few configuration parameters:

```python
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI
import os

llm = ChatOpenAI(
    api_key=os.environ["GITHUB_TOKEN"],
    base_url="https://models.github.ai/inference",
    model="openai/gpt-4o-mini",
)

# Send a simple prompt
response = llm.invoke("What's the capital of France?")
print(response.content)
```

**Here's what this code accomplishes:**
- **Creates** a LangChain client using the `ChatOpenAI` class
- **Configures** the connection to GitHub Models with your authentication token
- **Specifies** the AI model (`gpt-4o-mini`) for processing requests
- **Sends** a prompt using the `invoke()` method
- **Extracts** and displays the response content

> ðŸ”§ **Setup Note**: In GitHub Codespaces, the `GITHUB_TOKEN` environment variable is automatically available. For local development, you'll need to create a personal access token with appropriate permissions.

**Expected output:**
```text
The capital of France is Paris.
```

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant App as Your Python App
    participant LC as LangChain
    participant GM as GitHub Models
    participant AI as GPT-4o-mini
    
    App->>LC: llm.invoke("What's the capital of France?")
    LC->>GM: HTTP request with prompt
    GM->>AI: Process prompt
    AI->>GM: Generated response
    GM->>LC: Return response
    LC->>App: response.content
```

## Building conversational AI

The previous example demonstrated zero-shot promptingâ€”a single question with a single response. However, most real-world AI applications require maintaining context across multiple exchanges, just like human conversations.

LangChain provides message types that help structure conversations and define AI personality, making it easy to build sophisticated chat experiences.

### Understanding message types

LangChain uses different message classes to represent conversation participants:

| Message Type | Purpose | Example Use Case |
|--------------|---------|------------------|
| `SystemMessage` | Defines AI personality and behavior | "You are a helpful coding assistant" |
| `HumanMessage` | Represents user input | "Explain how functions work" |
| `AIMessage` | Stores AI responses | Previous AI responses in conversation |

### Creating your first conversation

Let's build a conversation where the AI adopts a specific personality:

```python
messages = [
    SystemMessage(content="You are Captain Picard of the Starship Enterprise"),
    HumanMessage(content="Tell me about you"),
]
```

**Breaking down this conversation setup:**
- **Establishes** the AI's role and personality through `SystemMessage`
- **Provides** the initial user query via `HumanMessage`
- **Creates** a foundation for multi-turn conversation

The full code for this example looks like so:

```python
from langchain_core.messages import HumanMessage, SystemMessage
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI
import os

llm = ChatOpenAI(
    api_key=os.environ["GITHUB_TOKEN"],
    base_url="https://models.github.ai/inference",
    model="openai/gpt-4o-mini",
)

messages = [
    SystemMessage(content="You are Captain Picard of the Starship Enterprise"),
    HumanMessage(content="Tell me about you"),
]


# works
response  = llm.invoke(messages)
print(response.content)
```

You should see an outcome similar to:

```text
I am Captain Jean-Luc Picard, the commanding officer of the USS Enterprise (NCC-1701-D), a starship in the United Federation of Planets. My primary mission is to explore new worlds, seek out new life and new civilizations, and boldly go where no one has gone before. 

I believe in the importance of diplomacy, reason, and the pursuit of knowledge. My crew is diverse and skilled, and we often face challenges that test our resolve, ethics, and ingenuity. Throughout my career, I have encountered numerous species, grappled with complex moral dilemmas, and have consistently sought peaceful solutions to conflicts.

I hold the ideals of the Federation close to my heart, believing in the importance of cooperation, understanding, and respect for all sentient beings. My experiences have shaped my leadership style, and I strive to be a thoughtful and just captain. How may I assist you further?
```

To keep the state of the conversation, you can add the response from a chat, so conversation is remembered, here's how to do that:

```python
from langchain_core.messages import HumanMessage, SystemMessage
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI
import os

llm = ChatOpenAI(
    api_key=os.environ["GITHUB_TOKEN"],
    base_url="https://models.github.ai/inference",
    model="openai/gpt-4o-mini",
)

messages = [
    SystemMessage(content="You are Captain Picard of the Starship Enterprise"),
    HumanMessage(content="Tell me about you"),
]


# works
response  = llm.invoke(messages)

print(response.content)

print("---- Next ----")

messages.append(response)
messages.append(HumanMessage(content="Now that I know about you, I'm Chris, can I be in your crew?"))

response  = llm.invoke(messages)

print(response.content)

```

What we can see from the above conversation is how we invoke the LLM two times, first with the conversation consisting of just two messages but then a second time with more messages added to the conversation. 

In fact, if you run this, you will see the second response being something like:

```text
Welcome aboard, Chris! It's always a pleasure to meet those who share a passion for exploration and discovery. While I cannot formally offer you a position on the Enterprise right now, I encourage you to pursue your aspirations. We are always in need of talented individuals with diverse skills and backgrounds. 

If you are interested in space exploration, consider education and training in the sciences, engineering, or diplomacy. The values of curiosity, resilience, and teamwork are crucial in Starfleet. Should you ever find yourself on a starship, remember to uphold the principles of the Federation: peace, understanding, and respect for all beings. Your journey can lead you to remarkable adventures, whether in the stars or on the ground. Engage!
```

I'll take that as a maybe ;)

## Streaming responses

Streaming responses provide real-time feedback as the AI generates content, creating a more interactive user experience similar to ChatGPT's typing effect. Instead of waiting for the complete response, you receive content as it's generated.

### Implementing streaming with LangChain

```python
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI
import os

llm = ChatOpenAI(
    api_key=os.environ["GITHUB_TOKEN"],
    base_url="https://models.github.ai/inference",
    model="openai/gpt-4o-mini",
    streaming=True
)

# Stream the response
for chunk in llm.stream("Write a short story about a robot learning to code"):
    print(chunk.content, end="", flush=True)
```

**Key streaming concepts:**
- **Enables** real-time content delivery as the AI generates responses
- **Improves** user experience with immediate feedback
- **Reduces** perceived latency for longer responses
- **Allows** early response processing and display

> ðŸ’¡ **User Experience Tip**: Streaming is particularly valuable for longer responses like code explanations, creative writing, or detailed tutorials where users benefit from seeing progress immediately.

## Prompt templates

Prompt templates help you create reusable, dynamic prompts by separating the structure from the variable content. Think of them as mad-libs for AI promptsâ€”you define the template once and fill in different values as needed.

### Creating reusable prompts

```python
from langchain_core.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate

# Define a template for code explanations
template = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages([
    ("system", "You are an expert programming instructor. Explain concepts clearly with examples."),
    ("human", "Explain {concept} in {language} with a practical example for {skill_level} developers")
])

# Use the template with different values
questions = [
    {"concept": "functions", "language": "JavaScript", "skill_level": "beginner"},
    {"concept": "classes", "language": "Python", "skill_level": "intermediate"},
    {"concept": "async/await", "language": "JavaScript", "skill_level": "advanced"}
]

for question in questions:
    prompt = template.format_messages(**question)
    response = llm.invoke(prompt)
    print(f"Topic: {question['concept']}\n{response.content}\n---\n")
```

**Template benefits in practice:**
- **Standardizes** prompt structure across your application
- **Enables** dynamic content insertion without string manipulation
- **Maintains** consistent AI behavior and output quality
- **Simplifies** prompt maintenance and updates

## Structured output

Structured output ensures AI responses follow a specific format, making them easier to parse and integrate into your applications. Instead of free-form text, you can request JSON, specific data structures, or formatted responses.

### Defining output schemas

```python
from langchain_core.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate
from langchain_core.output_parsers import JsonOutputParser
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field

class CodeReview(BaseModel):
    score: int = Field(description="Code quality score from 1-10")
    strengths: list[str] = Field(description="List of code strengths")
    improvements: list[str] = Field(description="List of suggested improvements")
    overall_feedback: str = Field(description="Summary feedback")

# Set up the parser
parser = JsonOutputParser(pydantic_object=CodeReview)

# Create prompt with format instructions
prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages([
    ("system", "You are a code reviewer. {format_instructions}"),
    ("human", "Review this code: {code}")
])

# Format the prompt with instructions
chain = prompt | llm | parser

# Get structured response
code_sample = """
def calculate_average(numbers):
    return sum(numbers) / len(numbers)
"""

result = chain.invoke({
    "code": code_sample,
    "format_instructions": parser.get_format_instructions()
})

print(f"Score: {result['score']}")
print(f"Strengths: {', '.join(result['strengths'])}")
```

**Structured output advantages:**
- **Guarantees** consistent response format for reliable parsing
- **Enables** direct integration with databases and APIs
- **Validates** AI responses against predefined schemas
- **Simplifies** error handling and data processing

## Tool calling

Tools are how we give the LLM extra skills. The idea is to tell the LLM about functions it has and if a prompt is made that matches the description of one of these tools then we call them. 

### Using Python

Let's add some tools like so:

```python
from typing_extensions import Annotated, TypedDict

class add(TypedDict):
    """Add two integers."""

    # Annotations must have the type and can optionally include a default value and description (in that order).
    a: Annotated[int, ..., "First integer"]
    b: Annotated[int, ..., "Second integer"]

tools = [add]

functions = {
    "add": lambda a, b: a + b
}
```

What we're doing here is to create a description of a tool called `add`. By inheriting from `TypedDict` and adding members like `a` and `b` of type `Annotated` this can be converted to a schema that the LLM can understand. The creation of functions is a dictionary that ensures that we know what to do if a specific tool is identified.

Let's see how we call the LLM with this tool next:

```python
llm = ChatOpenAI(
    api_key=os.environ["GITHUB_TOKEN"],
    base_url="https://models.github.ai/inference",
    model="openai/gpt-4o-mini",
)

llm_with_tools = llm.bind_tools(tools)
```

Here we call `bind_tools` with our `tools` array and thereby the LLM `llm_with_tools` now has knowledge of this tool.

To use this new LLM, we can type the following code:

```python
query = "What is 3 + 12?"

res = llm_with_tools.invoke(query)
if(res.tool_calls):
    for tool in res.tool_calls:
        print("TOOL CALL: ", functions[tool["name"]](**tool["args"]))
print("CONTENT: ",res.content)
```

Now that we call `invoke` on this new llm, that has tools, we maybe the the property `tool_calls` populated. If so, any identified tools has a `name` and `args` property that identifies what tool should be called and with arguments. The full code looks like so:

```python
from langchain_core.messages import HumanMessage, SystemMessage
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI
import os
from typing_extensions import Annotated, TypedDict

class add(TypedDict):
    """Add two integers."""

    # Annotations must have the type and can optionally include a default value and description (in that order).
    a: Annotated[int, ..., "First integer"]
    b: Annotated[int, ..., "Second integer"]

tools = [add]

functions = {
    "add": lambda a, b: a + b
}

llm = ChatOpenAI(
    api_key=os.environ["GITHUB_TOKEN"],
    base_url="https://models.github.ai/inference",
    model="openai/gpt-4o-mini",
)

llm_with_tools = llm.bind_tools(tools)

query = "What is 3 + 12?"

res = llm_with_tools.invoke(query)
if(res.tool_calls):
    for tool in res.tool_calls:
        print("TOOL CALL: ", functions[tool["name"]](**tool["args"]))
print("CONTENT: ",res.content)
```

Running this code, you should see output similar to:

```text
TOOL CALL:  15
CONTENT: 
```

What this output mean is that the LLM analyzed the prompt "What is 3 + 12" as meaning that the `add` tool should be called and it knew that thanks to its name, description and member field descriptions. That the answer is 15 is because of our code using the dictionary `functions` to invoke it:

```python
print("TOOL CALL: ", functions[tool["name"]](**tool["args"]))
```

### A more interesting tool that calls a web api

Tools that adds two numbers is interesting as it illustrates how tool calling works but usually tools tend to do something more interesting like for example calling a Web API, let's do just that with this code:

```python
class joke(TypedDict):
    """Tell a joke."""

    # Annotations must have the type and can optionally include a default value and description (in that order).
    category: Annotated[str, ..., "The joke category"]

def get_joke(category: str) -> str:
    response = requests.get(f"https://api.chucknorris.io/jokes/random?category={category}", headers={"Accept": "application/json"})
    if response.status_code == 200:
        return response.json().get("value", f"Here's a {category} joke!")
    return f"Here's a {category} joke!"

functions = {
    "add": lambda a, b: a + b,
    "joke": lambda category: get_joke(category)
}

query = "Tell me a joke about animals"

# the rest of the code is the same
```

Now if you run this code you will get a response saying something like:

```text
TOOL CALL:  Chuck Norris once rode a nine foot grizzly bear through an automatic car wash, instead of taking a shower.
CONTENT:  
```

Here's the code in its entirety:

```python
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI
import requests
import os
from typing_extensions import Annotated, TypedDict

class add(TypedDict):
    """Add two integers."""

    # Annotations must have the type and can optionally include a default value and description (in that order).
    a: Annotated[int, ..., "First integer"]
    b: Annotated[int, ..., "Second integer"]

class joke(TypedDict):
    """Tell a joke."""

    # Annotations must have the type and can optionally include a default value and description (in that order).
    category: Annotated[str, ..., "The joke category"]

tools = [add, joke]

def get_joke(category: str) -> str:
    response = requests.get(f"https://api.chucknorris.io/jokes/random?category={category}", headers={"Accept": "application/json"})
    if response.status_code == 200:
        return response.json().get("value", f"Here's a {category} joke!")
    return f"Here's a {category} joke!"

functions = {
    "add": lambda a, b: a + b,
    "joke": lambda category: get_joke(category)
}

llm = ChatOpenAI(
    api_key=os.environ["GITHUB_TOKEN"],
    base_url="https://models.github.ai/inference",
    model="openai/gpt-4o-mini",
)

llm_with_tools = llm.bind_tools(tools)

query = "Tell me a joke about animals"

res = llm_with_tools.invoke(query)
if(res.tool_calls):
    for tool in res.tool_calls:
        # print("TOOL CALL: ", tool)
        print("TOOL CALL: ", functions[tool["name"]](**tool["args"]))
print("CONTENT: ",res.content)
```

## Embeddings and document processing

Embeddings transform text into numerical vectors that capture semantic meaning, enabling similarity searches, content clustering, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). Think of embeddings as converting text into coordinates in a multi-dimensional space where similar meanings cluster together.

### Creating and using embeddings

```python
from langchain_openai import OpenAIEmbeddings
from langchain_community.vectorstores import FAISS
from langchain_community.document_loaders import TextLoader
from langchain.text_splitter import CharacterTextSplitter

# Initialize embeddings
embeddings = OpenAIEmbeddings(
    api_key=os.environ["GITHUB_TOKEN"],
    base_url="https://models.github.ai/inference",
    model="text-embedding-3-small"
)

# Load and split documents
loader = TextLoader("documentation.txt")
documents = loader.load()

text_splitter = CharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=1000, chunk_overlap=0)
texts = text_splitter.split_documents(documents)

# Create vector store
vectorstore = FAISS.from_documents(texts, embeddings)

# Perform similarity search
query = "How do I handle user authentication?"
similar_docs = vectorstore.similarity_search(query, k=3)

for doc in similar_docs:
    print(f"Relevant content: {doc.page_content[:200]}...")
```

### Document loaders for various formats

```python
from langchain_community.document_loaders import (
    PyPDFLoader,
    CSVLoader,
    JSONLoader,
    WebBaseLoader
)

# Load different document types
pdf_loader = PyPDFLoader("manual.pdf")
csv_loader = CSVLoader("data.csv")
json_loader = JSONLoader("config.json")
web_loader = WebBaseLoader("https://example.com/docs")

# Process all documents
all_documents = []
for loader in [pdf_loader, csv_loader, json_loader, web_loader]:
    docs = loader.load()
    all_documents.extend(docs)
```

**Embedding use cases:**
- **Powers** semantic search across your content
- **Enables** question-answering over your documents
- **Supports** content recommendation systems
- **Facilitates** automatic document categorization

## Building a complete AI application

Now let's combine everything you've learned into a practical AI application. We'll create a coding assistant that can answer questions, execute tools, and maintain conversation context.

### Complete application example

    def setup_tools(self):

            query: Annotated[str, "Search query for programming help"]
        
        class code_formatter(TypedDict):
            """Format and validate code snippets."""
            code: Annotated[str, "Code to format"]
            language: Annotated[str, "Programming language"]
        
        self.tools = [web_search, code_formatter]
        self.llm_with_tools = self.llm.bind_tools(self.tools)
    
    def chat(self, user_input: str):
        # Add user message to conversation
        self.conversation_history.append(HumanMessage(content=user_input))
        
        # Get AI response
        response = self.llm_with_tools.invoke(self.conversation_history)
        
        # Handle tool calls if any
        if response.tool_calls:
            for tool_call in response.tool_calls:
                tool_result = self.execute_tool(tool_call)
                print(f"ðŸ”§ Tool used: {tool_call['name']}")
                print(f"ðŸ“Š Result: {tool_result}")
        
        # Add AI response to conversation
        self.conversation_history.append(response)
        
        return response.content
    
    def execute_tool(self, tool_call):
        tool_name = tool_call['name']
        args = tool_call['args']
        
        if tool_name == 'web_search':
            return f"Found documentation for: {args['query']}"
        elif tool_name == 'code_formatter':
            return f"Formatted {args['language']} code: {args['code'][:50]}..."
        
        return "Tool execution completed"

# Usage example
assistant = CodingAssistant()

print("ðŸ¤– Coding Assistant Ready! Type 'quit' to exit.\n")

while True:
    user_input = input("You: ")
    if user_input.lower() == 'quit':
        break
    
    response = assistant.chat(user_input)
    print(f"ðŸ¤– Assistant: {response}\n")
```
