Functions are the building blocks of modern JavaScript programming and one of the most powerful concepts you'll master as a web developer. They allow you to package code into reusable blocks, making your programs more organized, efficient, and easier to maintain. Think of functions as specialized tools in your programming toolkit â€“ each one designed to accomplish a specific task whenever you need it.

In this lesson, you'll discover how to create your own functions, pass information to them, and get meaningful results back. You'll learn the difference between functions and methods, explore various ways to write functions (including modern arrow function syntax), and understand how functions can accept other functions as parameters. These concepts form the foundation for writing clean, professional JavaScript code.

By the end of this lesson, you'll be confidently creating functions that solve real-world problems and understanding how they fit into the bigger picture of web development. Let's dive in and unlock these fundamental programming concepts together!

## Functions

Now that you understand why functions are essential, let's explore what they actually are and how they work. A function is like a mini-program within your larger program â€“ a self-contained block of code that performs a specific task.

At its core, a function is a block of code we can execute on demand. This is perfect for scenarios where we need to perform the same task multiple times; rather than duplicating the logic in multiple locations (which would make it hard to update when the time comes), we can centralize it in one location, and call it whenever we need the operation performed - you can even call functions from other functions!.

Just as important is the ability to name a function. While this might seem trivial, the name provides a quick way of documenting a section of code. You could think of this as a label on a button. If I click on a button which reads "Cancel timer", I know it's going to stop running the clock. 

## Creating and calling a function

Let's create your first function together! We'll start with the basic syntax and build up to more complex examples as your confidence grows.

The syntax for a function looks like the following:

```javascript
function nameOfFunction() { // function definition
 // function definition/body
}
```

**Here's what this code structure includes:**
- **Uses** the `function` keyword to declare a new function
- **Provides** a descriptive name for the function (`nameOfFunction`)
- **Contains** parentheses `()` where parameters can be added later
- **Wraps** the function body in curly braces `{}`
- **Includes** comments to help identify the different parts

If I wanted to create a function to display a greeting, it might look like this:

```javascript
function displayGreeting() {
  console.log('Hello, world!');
}
```

**Breaking down what happens here:**
- **Defines** a function named `displayGreeting` with no parameters
- **Uses** `console.log()` to output a message to the browser's developer console
- **Contains** the string `'Hello, world!'` as the message to display
- **Creates** a reusable block of code that can be called multiple times

Whenever we want to call (or invoke) our function, we use the name of the function followed by `()`. It's worth noting the fact our function can be defined before or after we decide to call it; the JavaScript compiler will find it for you.

```javascript
// calling our function
displayGreeting();
```

**What this function call accomplishes:**
- **Executes** the code inside the `displayGreeting` function
- **Displays** "Hello, world!" in the browser console
- **Demonstrates** how to invoke a function using its name and parentheses
- **Shows** that functions can be called multiple times throughout your code

> **NOTE:** There is a special type of function known as a **method**, which you've already been using! In fact, we saw this in our demo above when we used `console.log()`. What makes a method different from a function is a method is attached to an object (`console` in our example), while a function is free floating. You will hear many developers use these terms interchangeably.

### Function best practices

There are a handful of best practices to keep in mind when creating functions

- As always, use descriptive names so you know what the function will do
- Use **camelCasing** to combine words
- Keep your functions focused on a specific task

## Passing information to a function

Our current `displayGreeting` function works, but it's quite limited â€“ it can only say "Hello, world!" to everyone. Let's make it more flexible and personal by learning how to pass information into functions.

To make a function more reusable you'll often want to pass information into it. If we consider our `displayGreeting` example above, it will only display **Hello, world!**. Not the most useful function one could create. If we want to make it a little more flexible, like allowing someone to specify the name of the person to greet, we can add a **parameter**. A parameter (also sometimes called an **argument**), is additional information sent to a function.

Parameters are listed in the definition part within parenthesis and are comma separated like so:

```javascript
function name(param, param2, param3) {

}
```

**Understanding these concepts:**
- **Lists** parameters inside the parentheses, separated by commas
- **Accepts** multiple pieces of information (param, param2, param3)
- **Creates** placeholders that will hold the actual values when the function is called
- **Allows** the same function to work with different data each time

We can update our `displayGreeting` to accept a name and have that displayed.

```javascript
function displayGreeting(name) {
  const message = `Hello, ${name}!`;
  console.log(message);
}
```

**In the above, we've:**
- **Added** a `name` parameter to receive the person's name
- **Created** a template literal using backticks and `${}` syntax for string interpolation
- **Stored** the personalized message in a `const` variable called `message`
- **Displayed** the customized greeting using `console.log()`

When we want to call our function and pass in the parameter, we specify it in the parenthesis.

```javascript
displayGreeting('Christopher');
// displays "Hello, Christopher!" when run
```

**Step by step, here's what's happening:**
- **Calls** the `displayGreeting` function with the string `'Christopher'`
- **Passes** the name as an argument to the `name` parameter
- **Substitutes** `'Christopher'` into the template literal
- **Outputs** "Hello, Christopher!" to the console

## Default values

Sometimes you want to make parameters optional by providing sensible defaults. This makes your functions more flexible and easier to use.

We can make our function even more flexible by adding more parameters. But what if we don't want to require every value be specified? Keeping with our greeting example, we could leave name as required (we need to know who we're greeting), but we want to allow the greeting itself to be customized as desired. If someone doesn't want to customize it, we provide a default value instead. To provide a default value to a parameter, we set it much in the same way we set a value for a variable - `parameterName = 'defaultValue'`. To see a full example:

```javascript
function displayGreeting(name, salutation='Hello') {
  console.log(`${salutation}, ${name}`);
}
```

**Key points to remember:**
- **Defines** `name` as a required parameter (no default value)
- **Sets** `salutation` with a default value of `'Hello'`
- **Uses** the assignment operator `=` to specify the default
- **Allows** the function to work with just one argument or both

When we call the function, we can then decide if we want to set a value for `salutation`.

```javascript
displayGreeting('Christopher');
// displays "Hello, Christopher"

displayGreeting('Christopher', 'Hi');
// displays "Hi, Christopher"
```

**What you need to know:**
- **Uses** the default value `'Hello'` when only the name is provided
- **Overrides** the default with `'Hi'` when both parameters are specified
- **Demonstrates** how optional parameters make functions more flexible
- **Shows** that required parameters come before optional ones

## Return values

So far, our functions have only displayed messages, but often you'll want functions to calculate something and give you back a result that you can use in other parts of your code.

Up until now the function we built will always output to the [console](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/console). Sometimes this can be exactly what we're looking for, especially when we create functions which will be calling other services. But what if I want to create a helper function to perform a calculation and provide the value back so I can use it elsewhere?

We can do this by using a **return value**. A return value is returned by the function, and can be stored in a variable just the same as we could store a literal value such as a string or number.

If a function does return something then the keyword `return` is used. The `return` keyword expects a value or reference of what's being returned like so:

```javascript
return myVariable;
```

**Understanding these concepts:**
- **Uses** the `return` keyword to send a value back to the caller
- **Ends** function execution immediately when the return statement runs
- **Allows** the returned value to be stored in a variable or used directly
- **Provides** a way for functions to produce results rather than just side effects

We could create a function to create a greeting message and return the value back to the caller

```javascript
function createGreetingMessage(name) {
  const message = `Hello, ${name}`;
  return message;
}
```

**Breaking down what happens here:**
- **Creates** a personalized message using template literal syntax
- **Stores** the message in a `const` variable for clarity
- **Returns** the message string to whoever called the function
- **Allows** the calling code to use the result however it needs

When calling this function we'll store the value in a variable. This is much the same way we'd set a variable to a static value (like `const name = 'Christopher'`).

```javascript
const greetingMessage = createGreetingMessage('Christopher');
```

**What this accomplishes:**
- **Calls** the `createGreetingMessage` function with `'Christopher'` as the argument
- **Receives** the returned string "Hello, Christopher"
- **Stores** the result in the `greetingMessage` variable
- **Makes** the greeting message available for use elsewhere in the code

## Functions as parameters for functions

One of the most powerful features in JavaScript is the ability to pass functions to other functions. This might sound complex, but it's actually a pattern you'll use frequently in modern web development.

As you progress in your programming career, you will come across functions which accept functions as parameters. This neat trick is commonly used when we don't know when something is going to occur or complete, but we know we need to perform an operation in response.

As an example, consider [setTimeout](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/WindowOrWorkerGlobalScope/setTimeout), which begins a timer and will execute code when it completes. We need to tell it what code we want to execute. Sounds like a perfect job for a function!

If you run the code below, after 3 seconds you'll see the message **3 seconds has elapsed**.

```javascript
function displayDone() {
  console.log('3 seconds has elapsed');
}
// timer value is in milliseconds
setTimeout(displayDone, 3000);
```

**Here's what this code does:**
- **Defines** a function called `displayDone` that logs a message
- **Uses** `setTimeout()` to schedule the function to run later
- **Passes** the function name (without parentheses) as the first parameter
- **Sets** the delay to 3000 milliseconds (3 seconds)

### Anonymous functions

Sometimes you need a function for just one specific purpose and don't want to clutter your code with extra function names. JavaScript provides a perfect solution for this scenario.

Let's take another look at what we've built. We're creating a function with a name which will be used one time. As our application gets more complex, we can see ourselves creating a lot of functions which will only be called once. This isn't ideal. As it turns out, we don't always need to provide a name!

When we are passing a function as a parameter we can bypass creating one in advance and instead build one as part of the parameter. We use the same `function` keyword, but instead we build it as a parameter.

Let's rewrite the code above to use an anonymous function:

```javascript
setTimeout(function() {
  console.log('3 seconds has elapsed');
}, 3000);
```

**In the above, we've:**
- **Created** a function directly inside the `setTimeout` call
- **Eliminated** the need for a separate function declaration
- **Used** the `function` keyword without a name
- **Achieved** the same result with less code

If you run our new code you'll notice we get the same results. We've created a function, but didn't have to give it a name!

### Fat arrow functions

Modern JavaScript provides an even more concise way to write functions using arrow syntax. This is a popular and widely-used feature in contemporary web development.

One shortcut common in a lot of programming languages (including JavaScript) is the ability to use what's called an **arrow** or **fat arrow** function. It uses a special indicator of `=>`, which looks like an arrow - thus the name! By using `=>`, we are able to skip the `function` keyword.

Let's rewrite our code one more time to use a fat arrow function:

```javascript
setTimeout(() => {
  console.log('3 seconds has elapsed');
}, 3000);
```

**What you need to remember:**
- **Uses** parentheses `()` for the parameter list (empty in this case)
- **Includes** the arrow `=>` to indicate this is an arrow function
- **Maintains** the same curly braces `{}` for the function body
- **Provides** a more concise syntax popular in modern JavaScript

### When to use each strategy

You've now seen we have three ways to pass a function as a parameter and might be wondering when to use each. If you know you'll be using the function more than once, create it as normal. If you'll be using it for just the one location, it's generally best to use an anonymous function. Whether or not you use a fat arrow function or the more traditional `function` syntax is up to you, but you will notice most modern developers prefer `=>`.
